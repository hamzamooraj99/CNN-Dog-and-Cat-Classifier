# Dog and Cat Classification Model using a CNN
This is a Covolutional Neural Network Classification Model that classifies images of dogs or cats.

## Dataset
The dataset for this model is already split into a training and test set.
### Training Set
The training set includes a total of 8000 images of dogs and cats with a 50/50 split (4000 images of dogs and 4000 images of cats)
### Test Set
The test set includes a total of 4000 images of dogs and cats with a 50/50 split (2000 images of dogs and 2000 images of cats)
### Single Prediction
This folder contains higher quality images of dogs and cats to test the CNN with.

## Implementation
I made use of a python notebook (.ipynb) to implement and train this CNN model. The model was made using the Tensorflow 2.0 library in Python.
